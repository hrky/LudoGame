## Running the Project ##
Most group members used Netbeans 7.3 and JRE 1.7 to code this project, although the code should be IDE-independent. Please follow these instructions to get it to run:

1. Clone this Repo or [download it](https://github.com/bxio/SEng271/archive/master.zip) in some other fashion.
2. CD to the download location and run `ant jar` to compile the project. This requires the [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) utility
3. Double-click the SEng271.jar file under `./dist`

Or Open this folder directly in Netbeans
